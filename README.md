# Gold-Price-Prediction-for-Indian-Market-Using-Time-Series-Methods

The amount of data created in the world is increasing exponentially day by day and the technology to process the data as well. So, with the technology we have today we can process this data and find solutions for a lot of things which were hard to find before. In this thesis, we are considering such a kind of area which was not easy to process before. The aim of this thesis is to forecast the daily gold price in India and help the common people and the producers to choose the right date to buy gold and save the money in a more accurate way than traditional mind calculations. We are predicting the gold price in India using the time series methods ARIMA, Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing and Linear Regression and compared them to get the perfect model for the prediction. From these models, the best fitting model is selected, and prediction is done. After this project, any people who are looking to buy or sell gold in India can depend on the final model selected and can sell or buy this precious metal at the right time and for the right money.
